1. Performed the rental_analysis homework following the starter code
2. Completed all graphs except those of the optional challenge:
    * Create a bar chart row facet to plot the average house values for all Toronto neighbourhoods per year 
    * Create a sunburst chart to conduct a cost analysis of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Toronto per year.
3. Performed the rental_analysis follwoing the starter code
4. Completed the dashboard for all graphs except those of the optional challemge in rental_analysis (refer to point 2 of this readme)
5. At each step validated each graph and subsequently each tab for the dashboard
6. Identified duplicates in the tab "Shelter cost vs House Value". these are not reflected when serving the dashboard. Checked several times with TA and Ask BCS and they suggested no issue with the code.
